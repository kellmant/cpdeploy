.....you can now run shellcontrol (should be used during startup) to take over ssh access to gateways and manager from this console. You can also backup this configuration at any time (in its running state) using 'backmeup'. There is a command, 'getmeback' that will restore a previous config, but should only be used during the startup of a new controller.
