- fixed timer issue so it reports on status properly
4.4
- cleaned up allot of little things, and fixed bad timer issue on autodeploy, it should work in a reasonable amount of time now. Cleaned up console refresh, and input capture, should be much smoother, as well as clean up lost screen issue (random) when capturing input, copy cursur position and restore, as well as end of line curser writes. Moving to git and adding this as docker hub kellman/cpdeploy:beta for live test. Hoping a community of much smarter people make this more useable for a larger audience.
